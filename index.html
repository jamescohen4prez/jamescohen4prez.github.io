            <p>I’ve had the privilege to be a part of the UBC community for 5 years; I've experienced everything wonderful about our campus, from Wreck Beach, to world class teaching, to the Pit Pub on Wednesday nights! Most importantly I have been immensely happy here and my goal is to make sure everyone here has that same opportunity! I am driven by purpose and I’m determined to bring about the most positive change possible for the students of our campus!</p>

                      James is the most inspiring, kind-hearted, and driven individual I have met during my time at UBC.  He is passionate about giving back to his community, and does so with fierce action. He is open, honest, and amazing guy to work with. Having worked with him in Party Well, I have seen the type of leader he is. James leads by example and he is the type of person that makes you want to be the best you can be.

                    <p>My first impression of James Cohen was witnessing him negotiate a fundraising deal on the 99. From that day onward, I knew I wanted to get to know James better; I knew he was out to make a real unselfish contribution to the world. Having gotten to know him, I know that he is motivated by his contributions to the community. He is an altruistic, ambitious, and collected leader in the UBC Community, and I assure you that he will make his promises real, as your next AMS President.
                      Why do I think this? I have attended James’ events; I have had fun alongside him as friend; I have planned events with him as a co-host; and I have witnessed him facilitate meetings, arrange Win-win sponsorship deals, empower his team members, and negotiate partnerships with other student leaders… James is innovative, resilient, and positive. He understands student issues and has the follow-through to creatively address them, by empowering and supporting his team.</p>

                <p>Mental Health is a BIG issue on our campus and WE are going to fix this problem with a powerful package of wellness initiatives!</p>
                <h6>Strategies</h6><br>

                <ul>
                  <li>Making healthy food affordable for all students by supporting an expansion of the Sprouts and Seedlings nonprofit restaurants on our campus</li>
                  <li>Improving fitness through more recreation space by actively supporting the upcoming recreational referendum</li>
                  <li>Reducing stress levels by supporting a quiet nap space (with regulation)</li>
                  <li>Tackling the problem of sexual assault by expanding the Safewalk volunteer community that walks students home when they are most vulnerable (non-sober students are not taken care of)</li>
                  <li>Helping students suffering from mental health issues by increasing counselling service funding, making more counsellors available who are better trained.</li>
                  <li>Building on the progress that has been made to implement a fall reading break</li>
                  <li>Combatting anxiety through improving the awareness of career services across campus</li>

                </ul>
                <br />
                <h6>Reasoning</h6><br>

                <ul>
                  <li>AN ENTIRE PERCENT of UBC students have attempted suicide! That’s over 500 current students on our campus! </li>
                  <li>83% of sexually assaulted women suffer from and have disabilities such as mental health disorders (Stimpson & Best, 1991) and over 50% of post-secondary sexual assaults involve drugs or alcohol (Zawacki et al., 2003). It’s therefore shocking that Safewalk does not drive our students home when they have noticeably been drinking alcohol, as this has a direct affect on the wellbeing of our students, which is known to affect our studies. </li>
                  <li>⅔ UBC students have experienced an unhealthy level of stress or anxiety and this has substantially affected the school work of over half of us! (AMS Academic Experience Survey Report 2015/2016)</li>
                </ul>

                <h6>Student Programming</h6><br>
                <p>Our UBC community, school spirit, and student wellbeing will be amplified through connecting our student body with better and improved large-scale events! </p><br>
                <h6>Strategies</h6><br>

                <ul>
                  <li>Facilitating collaboration of clubs and student groups through more frequent and improve All Presidents meetings that facilitate introductions with ice breakers.</li>
                  <li>Having all up-to-date contact information for clubs will also facilitate collaboration, we will be more effective through synergy and will do bigger and better events on our campus!</li>
                  <li>Restoring Block Party effectively back to the PHILANTHROPIC glory of Arts County Fair will achieve immense discounts on production expenses, a massive volunteer team and more sponsorship funding for better artists. Combined with mass collaboration - any club can participate such that the percentage of tickets sold is the percentage of overall proceeds raised that can fund their cause - we can make history in selling out the 20,000 Thunderbird stadium. </li>
                </ul><br>

                <h6>Reasoning</h6><br>

                <ul>
                  <li>At events such as Winter Classic and Block Party, we really feel school spirit and UBC pride. These events are too few and far between, we need more of these and we need to improve on them to achieve school spirit anywhere near comparable to universities in the US. </li>
                  <li>Our campus used to be known as the home of the biggest student-run charity party on the face of the planet with over 15,000 attendees! This was Arts County Fair, which fundraised a lot for causes that students really cared about. Since this event’s peak in the 90s, the festival industry has grown tremendously and our campus potential to reinvigorate this event is larger than ever! </li>

                <p>The UBC Board of Governors currently doesn't take our student body very seriously. As a student activist, I will be a strong advocate for the students to make the positive change that we need into reality!</p><br>

                <h6>Strategies</h6><br>

                <ul>
                  <li>Leading the protests against tuition increases, standing up for the rights of residents, facilitating discussion effectively or even threatening a negative publicity campaign are all strategies that previous presidents have taken to advocate UBC students. My experience as an activist, a leader and an experienced communicator enable me to execute these strategies and others like no president previous. I will be at the forefront of these issues!</li>
                </ul><br>

                <h6>Reasoning</h6><br>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The UBC Board of Governors do not currently take our student body seriously. One prime example is when the referendum question passed for our campus to divest from fossil fuel dependence, the BOG made us vote again through faculties. This second vote also passed with flying colours YEARS AGO and practically nothing has been done about it since. A much stronger stance must be taken with the BOG to ensure that real change takes place and that is why student advocacy is essential.
